    "\n",
    "47. **What is the purpose of the `else` block in exception handling?**\n",
    "   - *Answer:* The `else` block is executed if no exceptions are raised in the associated `try` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "48. **Explain the difference between the `except Exception as e` and `except: Exception` syntax.**\n",

    "\n",
    "52. **What is inheritance in OOP, and how does it promote code reusability?**\n",
    "   - *Answer:* Inheritance allows a class (subclass/derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (base class/parent class), promoting code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "53. **What is polymorphism in OOP, and how is it implemented in Python?**\n",
    "   - *Answer:* Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. In Python, it's achieved through method overloading and overriding.\n",
    "\n",
    "54. **How do you create an instance of a class in Python?**\n",
    "   - *Answer:* Use the class name followed by parentheses, e.g., `my_instance = MyClass()`.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - *Answer:* Use the `@decorator_name` syntax above a function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "78. **Explain the concept of function closure in the context of decorators.**\n",
    "   - *Answer:* In the decorator context, a closure refers to a function that \"closes over\" variables from its outer scope. This allows decorators to access and remember variables even after the outer function has finished executing, enabling them to modify or extend the behavior of other functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "82. **What is the purpose of the `@classmethod` decorator?**\n",
    "   - *Answer:* `@classmethod` is used to define a class method within a class, which takes the class as its first argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "83. **How can you chain multiple decorators on a single function?**\n",
    "   - *Answer:* Decorators are applied in the order they are listed, so you can chain them by stacking them above the function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "84. **What is memoization, and how can it be implemented using decorators in Python?**\n",

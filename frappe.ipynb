    "1. **What is Frappe framework and what are its key features?**\n",
    "   - Frappe is a full-stack web application framework written in Python. Its key features include rapid application development, built-in authentication and authorization, role-based permissions, document-oriented database management, integrated development environment (Desk), support for customization and extensions, and a vibrant community.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Can you explain the architecture of Frappe framework?**\n",
    "   - Frappe follows a layered architecture with a database layer, business logic layer, and presentation layer. The database layer utilizes a document-oriented database management system. The business logic layer handles application logic and workflow management, while the presentation layer consists of HTML templates, client-side scripting with JavaScript, and CSS for styling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How does Frappe handle authentication and authorization?**\n",
    "   - Frappe provides built-in user authentication with password hashing and salt generation. It supports role-based permissions, where access to various parts of the application is controlled based on the user's role. Permissions are managed through the Role Permission Manager in the Desk.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What are the different components of a Frappe application?**\n",
    "   - The components of a Frappe application include DocTypes (document types), Controllers, Models, Views, Templates, Scripts, Hooks, and Integrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **How does Frappe support customization and extensions?**\n",
    "   - Frappe supports customization and extension through its built-in hooks system. Developers can create custom apps or extend existing ones by defining new DocTypes, controllers, models, views, and scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What databases does Frappe support, and how does it interact with them?**\n",
    "   - Frappe primarily supports the MariaDB/MySQL database. It interacts with the database through its ORM layer, allowing developers to define data models using Python classes, which are then translated into corresponding database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Describe the role of Document Types in Frappe framework.**\n",
    "   - Document Types define the structure and behavior of data in Frappe applications. They are defined using YAML files and consist of fields, methods, permissions, and workflow states. Documents in Frappe applications are instances of Document Types, which are stored in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **How does Frappe handle server-side scripting and client-side scripting?**\n",
    "   - Frappe uses Python for server-side scripting, where business logic and data manipulation are implemented. For client-side scripting, it utilizes JavaScript and jQuery for interactivity and dynamic behavior on the frontend.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Explain the difference between Controllers and Models in Frappe.**\n",
    "   - Models represent the data structure and handle database interactions, such as CRUD operations. Controllers handle application logic and orchestrate interactions between Models and Views.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **How does Frappe manage versioning and deployment of applications?**\n",
    "    - Frappe uses a version control system (usually Git) to manage application code and configurations. Deployment is typically done using the Frappe Bench CLI tool, which provides commands for setting up, updating, and managing deployments of Frappe applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **What are the advantages of using Frappe over other web frameworks?**\n",
    "    - Some advantages of Frappe include rapid application development, built-in features like authentication and permissions, an integrated development environment (Desk), support for customization and extensions, and a vibrant community contributing to its ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Can you discuss some common security considerations when developing with Frappe?**\n",
    "    - Security considerations include input validation to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, securing sensitive data through encryption, implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, and keeping the framework and dependencies up-to-date to patch any security vulnerabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **How does Frappe support internationalization and localization?**\n",
    "    - Frappe provides built-in support for internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n). Developers can mark translatable strings in their code using Frappe's translation function. Frappe also includes tools for managing translations, such as extracting translatable strings from code, translating them into multiple languages, and loading the appropriate translations based on the user's locale.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **What testing tools and methodologies are commonly used with Frappe applications?**\n",
    "    - Common testing approaches include unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. Frappe provides utilities and libraries for writing and running tests, such as the Frappe Test Runner.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Describe the workflow management capabilities of Frappe.**\n",
    "    - Frappe includes built-in support for defining and managing workflows through Workflow States and Transitions. Workflow States represent the different stages a document can be in, while Transitions define the rules for moving between states.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. **Can you explain the role of Desk in Frappe framework?**\n",
    "    - The Desk is an integrated development environment provided by Frappe for managing applications. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing documents, creating new content, configuring settings, and performing administrative tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. **How does Frappe handle background jobs and asynchronous tasks?**\n",
    "    - Frappe provides a built-in scheduler for managing background jobs and asynchronous tasks. Developers can define periodic tasks or one-time jobs using Frappe's scheduler API. Tasks are executed asynchronously by workers running in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. **What are the options for integrating external services or APIs with Frappe applications?**\n",
    "    - Frappe supports integration with external services and APIs through mechanisms such as HTTP requests, webhooks, and custom integrations using Frappe's REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. **How does Frappe handle caching and performance optimization?**\n",
    "    - Frappe includes built-in caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce database load. It supports caching at various levels, including database query caching, template caching, and server-side caching of computed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **Can you provide examples of real-world applications built using Frappe framework?**\n",
    "    - Examples include ERPNext (an open-source ERP system), HospitalRun (an open-source hospital information system), and various custom business applications developed by Frappe Technologies and its community. These applications demonstrate the versatility and scalability of the Frappe framework in building enterprise-grade solutions."
